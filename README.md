# Terrain_Identification_From_Time_Series_Data

* This is a classification task to find different terrains from time series data. The idea is to train a neural network using given data to classify which terrain an unknown data represents
* The dataset is available at https://ieee-dataport.org/open-access/lower-limb-prostheses-environmental-context-dataset
* The entire notebook is in the jupyter notebook format
* Change the paths of the training and test datasets accordingly
* Create the folders 'Subjects', 'ProcessedData' and 'InterpolatedData' in your project folder
* The functions will generate the test set predictions
